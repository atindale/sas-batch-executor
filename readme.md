# SAS Batch Executor

## Overview

This application spawned from the need for analysts who use SAS to have code execute analysis code on a regular automated basis without the need to go to IT or login to the server.

It does **not** replace a complex schedule of dependancies but allows very simple time based execution sequential scheduling of jobs.

## Grabbing this application

Just execute the following command to grab the application.

## Process

`run_jobs.sas` is executed every day, when the a marker file is created.
1.	Directory list of parms directory which should contain a file for each “flow”
a.	Job1.mail
b.	Job1.run

The `run` parameter file should contain:

```text
# This is Job1
#
SCHEDULE:AM:WEEKLY_1
Job1\first_program.sas
Job1\second_program.sas
```

The values for the `SCHEDULE` keyword are:

| Parameter     | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| AM/PM         | Morning or afternoon | 
| DAILY         | Daily | 
| DAILY_BD      | Daily on business days | 
| WEEKLY_1      | Weekly on the first day of the week |
| MONTHLY_1     | Monthly on the nth day of the week |
| MONTHLYBD_1   | Monthly on business day n |

## To Do
1.	Add a sasautos/format/autoexec location
2.	Set current_load_date in init_stmt
3.	Have run_jobs.sas create any logs/reports/sascode/sasdata
4.	Refine output styling process and document
